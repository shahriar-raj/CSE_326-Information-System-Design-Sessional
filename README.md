# CSE 326: Information System Design Sessional

This repository contains all home and lab assignments for the **CSE 326: Information System Design Sessional** course, part of the Term-2, Level-3 curriculum at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). The course focuses on applying theories from **CSE 325: Information System Design** to practical system design implementations.

## Course Overview

**CSE 326** is a 0.75 credit hour sessional course intended for Level 3 Term 2 students. It serves as a practical extension of **CSE 325**, allowing students to apply theoretical concepts in real-world scenarios.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several directories, each corresponding to a specific aspect of the system design process:

- **Project Scope Presentation**: Initial presentation outlining the project's objectives, requirements, and scope.
- **BPMN Diagram**: Business Process Model and Notation diagrams representing the business processes involved in the system.
- **Mock UI**: Mockups of the user interface, demonstrating the planned design and layout of the system's front end.
- **ER Diagram**: Entity-Relationship diagrams illustrating the data model and relationships between different entities in the system.
- **Class Diagram**: UML class diagrams detailing the system's object-oriented design, including classes, attributes, methods, and relationships.
- **Collaboration Diagram**: Diagrams showing interactions between objects and the sequence of messages exchanged to carry out functionality.
- **Sequence & State Diagram**: Sequence diagrams depicting object interactions over time and state diagrams showing state transitions of system components.
- **Report**: Comprehensive report documenting the system design process, decisions made, challenges encountered, and lessons learned.

## Assignments

Throughout the course, students completed various assignments to reinforce their understanding of system design principles:

- **Unit Testing**: Developing and executing test cases to ensure individual components function as intended.
- **Retailers Manufacturers System Project**: A comprehensive project involving:
  - **Use Case Diagram**: Identifying and representing the system's functional requirements and interactions with actors.
  - **UML Class Diagram**: Designing the system's structure with classes and relationships.
  - **Database Entity Relationship Diagram**: Modeling the database schema and entity relationships.
  - **Data Flow Diagram**: Illustrating the flow of information within the system.
  - **Sequence Diagram**: Detailing the sequence of interactions between objects for specific use cases.
  - **Implementation of User Interface of Order Subsystem**: Developing the front-end interface for managing orders.
  - **Project Report**: Documenting the entire project, including design decisions, implementation details, and testing results.
